# Inclass-Activity-Project1

Dinner & Chill, my first team project of the Bootcamp (with Facundo Rodriguez, Olutundun Gbogboade, and Ehab Abdlrasul) is a 'first date' app designed to take the stress out of a first date by: 
1) finding a restaurant for a first date querying Yelp's API based on zip code, food type, and price range, then displaying the results on a map provided by Leaflet's API, 
2) breaking the ice with a G-rated "dad joke," pulled from the Official Joke API, and 
3) finding the nearest open drugstore, using user geolocation, then displaying results on a map provided by Leaflet's API.  

# Privacy & Security
The app was designed to allow users to register then login so that they can personalize their experience (we were not able to implement this functionality, which will include a private space for keep notes on the date). User login information will be stored remotely.

The app can also be used anonymously. In addition, if users block geolocation, the drugstore search defaults to a zip code search. 

# Future Enhancements
Future improvements we plan to make in the app include:
- One-click Driving Directions that will indicate routes to restaurants and drugstores 
- Personalized User Accounts to allow note taking, restaurant reviews, etc., in a user's private space  
- Allow users to opt for ZIP code search instead of using geolocation to find nearest drugstore
- User Comment Wall / Star Rating System to get user feedback on the app
